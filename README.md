## John went for shopping.
Q: John went for shopping with ₹500 and bought the following:
<br>
1. Bread - ₹25
2. Rice (2 kg) - ₹69.2 per kg
3. Potatoes - ₹40
4. Onion - ₹37
5. Honey - ₹109.7
6. Spinach - ₹8
7. Cinnamon - ₹178
<br> <!--The comment tag and the line break HTML tags can even be used in MARKDOWN-->
There was a discount of 10%. Further, he already had an extra payment of ₹78 with the shopkeeper. So, finally how much amount is he left with?

Answer:
### Step 1:
Firstly, find the total amount of money he paid initially by adding all the values.
<br>

_25 + 69.2 (2) + 40 + 37 + 109.7 + 8 + 178 = 536.1_

### Step 2:
Now, find 10% of the sum and subtract that value from it as discount. Round it to nearest hundredths.
<br>

_536.1 - {(10/100) * 536.1} = 536.1 - 53.61 = 482.49_

### Step 3:
Money he is left with now =
<br>

_500 - 482.49 = 17.51_

### Step 4:
Since the shopkeeper gave the extra payment back so, subtract -78 from 17.51.
<br>

_17.51 - (-78) = 17.51 + 78 = 95.51_

**Hence, John was finally left with $95.51.**

## Sophia the microbiologist.
Q: Sophia is a microbiologist. She noticed that Bacteria A needs an optimum temperature of -25ºC to survive. Bacteria B needs -61ºC to survive. Whereas, Bacteria C needs 3/4th the temperature of the difference between the temperatures of Bacteria B and A. So, what is the optimal temperature that Bacteria C needs to survive?

Answer:
### Step 1:
Firstly find the difference between the temperatures required by Bacteria A and B to survive.
<br>

_-25 - (-61) = 36_

### Step 2:
Finally, calculate 3/4th of the difference.
<br>

_3/4 (36) = 27_

**Therefore, Bacteria C would need an optimal temperature of 27ºC to survive.**

## Excavation site
Q: At an excavation site, 2 meters can be dug in a minute. Three drillers with the same speed
dig on the same spot. After 10 mins, one of the drillers stopped working. If there was a fossil 180 meters below the land, how much time would it take to be found?

Answer:
### Step 1:
First, let's find out how many meters of the ground was dug in 10 mins by three drillers.
<br>

_3{-2 (10)} = 3 {-20} = -60_

### Step 2:
The remaining meters to be dug =
<br>

_-180 - (-60) = -120_
<br>

So we have to dig 120 meters more below the ground.

### Step 3:
Since there are 2 drillers, both of them can dig _2 × (-2) = **-4**_ **meters** below the ground. So, the time required to dig 120 meters below the ground is:
<br>

 _-120/-4 = 30_

### Step 4:
The total time taken by the 3 drillers and the time taken after one of them stopped working =
<br>

_10 + 30 = 40_

**Thus, it would take 40 minutes for the fossil to be reached and found.**

## True or False
Q: When you subtract a negative number from any number the answer should always be negative.
<br>

Answer:
**Not always. This is only true if the absolute value of the negative number being subtracted is greater than the absolute value of the other number.**

## Fill in the blank
Q: -159 - ___ = 99

Answer:
### Step 1:
Let's solve this problem like an **_Algebraic Equation_**. We can denote the number we need to find as a variable 'x'.
<!--Set var = x-->
<br>

_-159 - x = 99_

### Step 2:
We can now isolate the variable just like we would do in an Algebraic Equation. That can be done by adding 159 to both the sides.
<br>

_<del>-159 + 159</del> - x = 99 + 159_

### Step 3:
Simplify this further.
<br>

_-x = 99 + 159 = 258_

### Step 4:
Finally, to get the value of x, we can multiply both the sides by -1.
<br>

_-x (-1) = 258 (-1)_
_x = -258_

**Therefore, the correct answer is -258.**
